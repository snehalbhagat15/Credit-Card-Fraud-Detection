# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a Random Forest Classifier.

## Getting Started

This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python. It uses a real-world credit card dataset to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

1. Clone the Repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/snehalbhagat15/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
   ```

2. [Download the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) that will be used to train the transaction classifier. Unzip it and place the `creditcard.csv` file inside the main folder (`Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection`).

3. Install required Python packages if not already installed.  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fraud_detection_rf.ipynb
   ```
